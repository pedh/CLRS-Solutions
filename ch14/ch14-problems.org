   - a.

     If \(x\) is a point of maximum overlap, then we know that the closest
     endpoint of one of the segments to \(x\) is also a point of maximum
     overlap, thus there will always be a point of maximum overlap that is an
     endpoint of one of the segments.
   - b.

     We insert all the start and end endpoints of the intervals to a red-black
     tree, by augmenting the following attributes to the node \(x\)
     #+begin_src
     x.flag: 1 if x is the start endpoint of an interval, -1 if x is the end
       endpoint of an interval, 0 if x is the sentinel T.nil.
     x.flag-sum: the total sum of the flag attribute of all nodes in the subtree
       rooted at x, include x
     x.max-overlap: the number of maximum overlaps in the subtree rooted at x
     x.pom: the point of maximum overlap in the subtree rooted at x
     #+end_src
     Those attributes could be maintained as following
     #+begin_src
     x.flag:
       as description
     x.flag-sum:
       x.flag-sum = x.left.flag-sum + x.flag + x.right.flag-sum
     x.max-overlap and x.pom:
       x.max-overlap = max(
         x.left.max-overlap, (x.pom = x.left.pom)
         x.left.flag-sum + x.flag, (x.pom = x)
         x.left.flag-sum + x.flag + x.right.max-overlap, (x.pom = x.right.pom))
     #+end_src
     According to *Theorem 14.1*, the operations =INTERVAL-INSERT= and
     =INTERVAL-DELETE= run in \(O(\lg n)\) time. And =FIND-POM= run in \(O(1)\)
     time by simply retrieving \(T.root.pom\).
