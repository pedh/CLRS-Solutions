#+TITLE: Chapter 9.2

** 9.2-1
   If we make a recursive call to \(0\)-length array in line 8, then we have
   \(q - 1 < p\), and \(i < k = q - p + 1\), thus we have \(i < 1\), which is
   illegal.

   If we make a recursive call to \(0\)-length array in line 9, then we have
   \(r < q + 1\), and \(i > k = q - p + 1\), thus we have \(i > r - p + 1\),
   which is illegal.

   Thus RANDOMIZED-SELECT never makes a recursive call to a \(0\)-length array.
** 9.2-2
   The value \(T(max(k-1,n-k))\) does not affect the incicator random variable
   \(X_k\), and the \(X_k\) does not affect \(T(max(k-1,n-k))\) either, thus
   they are independent.

** 9.2-4
   The sequence of partitions results in a worst-case performance of
   RANDOMIZED-SELECT, if we always choose the maximum element of the subarray
   as the pivot.
