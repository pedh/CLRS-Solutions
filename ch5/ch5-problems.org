   - *a.*

     After each INCREMENT operation, the expected value represented by the
     counter increased by \(\frac{1}{n_{i+1}-n_i}(n_{i+1}-n_i) = 1\), thus the
     expected value represented by the counter after n INCREMENT operations have
     been performed is exactly n.
   - *b.*

     The variance of each INCREMENT operation is
     \begin{align*}
     Var\{X\}
     &=E[X^2]-E[X]^2\\
     &=99
     \end{align*}
     The n INCREMENT operations are independent, thus the total variance is
     \begin{align*}
     Var\{X[n]\}
     &=\sum_{i=1}^{n}Var\{X_i\}\\
     &=99n
     \end{align*}

     #+BEGIN_SRC
     RANDOM-SEARCH(A, x)
         let S to be an empty set
         n = A.length
         while S.length < n
             i = RANDOM(1, n)
             if i not in S
                 S.add(i)
                 if A[i] == x
                     return i
         return NIL
     #+END_SRC
   - *b.*

     The problems is a geometric distribution, the expected value of trials
     is \(n\).
   - *c.*

     The expected value of trials is \(n/k\).
   - *d.*

     The expected value of trials is \(n\ln n + O(1)\), the problem is
     equivalent to the problem of balls and bins which each bins contains
     at least one ball.
   - *e.*

     The average running time is \(\Theta((n+1)/2)\), the worst case running
     time is \(\Theta(n)\).
   - *f.*

     The average running time is \(\Theta((n+1)/(k+1))\), the worst case running
     time is \(\Theta(n-k+1)\).
   - *g.*

     The average running time and the worst case running time are the same
     \(\Theta(n)\).
   - *h.*

     Shuffling the input array costs \(\Theta(n)\) running time, the rest is
     same as DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH, the expected running time is the average
     running time of DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH.
   - *i.*

     I would never use the RANDOM-SEARCH, and I prefer SCRAMBLE-SEARCH to
     DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH when the input array is less random.
