#+TITLE: Chapter 5.1

* ch5.1
** 5.1-1
   Total order is a binary relation on some set X, which is antisymmetric,
   transitive, and a connex relation.

   A binary relation R is a total order on set X if the following statements
   hold for all a, b and c in X:

   - *Antisymmetry*:
     If \(aRb\) and \(bRa\), then \(a = b\).

   - *Transitivity*:
     If \(aRb\) and \(bRc\), then \(aRc\).

   - *Connexity*:
     Either or both of \(aRb\) or \(bRa\) hold(s).

   We could simply obtain the three statements from the assumption that we are
   always able to determine which candidate is best, hence we know a total order
   on the ranks of the candidates.

         for i = a to b
             a = a + RANDOM(0, 1)

     RANDOM-INT(a, b)
         while a < b
             mid = (a + b) // 2
             if RANDOM(0, 1) == 0
                 b = mid
             else a = mid + 1
         return a

       while True:
           x = BIASED-RANDOM()
           y = BIASED-RANDOM()
           if x > y
               return 1
           if x < y
               return 0
   #+END_SRC
   The expected running time is \(T(n) = \Theta(\frac{1}{2p(1-p)})\).
