** 5.2-1
   *Hire exact one time:* The best candidate appears first,
   the probability is \(\frac{1}{n}\).

   *Hire n times:* The candidates appears in decrease order,
   the probability is \(\frac{1}{n!}\).
** 5.2-2
   We know that the first candidate and the best candidate will
   always been hired, let the first candidate to be \(A[1]\), and the
   best candidate to be \(A[k]\), there should be \(A[1] = best(A[1..k-1])\)
   to hire exactly two candidates, i.e., choose the best of \(k-1\) candidates,
   the total probability is \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\frac{1}{k-1}\).
** 5.2-3
   The expected value of k-th dice is
   \begin{align*}
   E[X_k]
   &=\sum_{x=1}^{6}xPr{X_k=x}\\
   &=\sum_{x=1}^{6}\frac{x}{6}\\
   &=\frac{7}{2}
   \end{align*}
   The expected value of the sum of n dice is
   \begin{align*}
   E[X]
   &=E\Bigg[\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i\Bigg]\\
   &=\sum_{i=1}^{n}E[X_i]\\
   &=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{7}{2}\\
   &=\frac{7n}{2}
   \end{align*}
** 5.2-4
   Each customer has \(\frac{1}{n}\) probability to get back their own hat,
   the expected value is \(E[X_k] = \frac{1}{n}\).

   The total expected number of customers who get back their own hat is
   \(E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n}E[X_i] = 1\).
** 5.2-5
   The probability that a pair is an inversion is exactly \(\frac{1}{2}\),
   the expected value is \(E[X_{ij}] = \frac{1}{2}\).

   The total expected number of inversions is
   \begin{align*}
   E[X]
   &=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i}^{n}E[X_{ij}]\\
   &=\frac{n(n-1)}{4}
   \end{align*}
