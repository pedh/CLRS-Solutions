#+TITLE: Chapter 6.1

* ch6.1
** 6.1-1
   In a heap of height \(h\), the minimum numbers of elements is \(2^h\),
   the maximum numbers of elements is \(2^{h+1} - 1\).
** 6.1-2
   We know that \(2^h \leq n \leq 2^{h+1} - 1\), so that the height is
   \(h = \lfloor \lg n \rfloor\).
** 6.1-3
   All the nodes in the subtree were derived from the root, so that the root has
   contains the largest value in the subtree.
** 6.1-4
   The smallest elements only resides in the leaves.
** 6.1-5
   Certainly it is.
** 6.1-6
   No, because the parent of 7 is 6.
** 6.1-7
   The leaves are the nodes indexed by \(\{i\ |\ n < 2i, i\leq n\}\),
   i.e., \(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1, \lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 2,\ldots,n\).
