   Because the recursive MAX-HEAPIFY procedure was based on the premise that the
   children of the node are max heaps, so we must first build the nodes with
   larger index into max heaps.
** 6.3-3
   We prove the hypothesis with mathematical induction.

   *Base case:* There are at most \(\lceil n/2 \rceil\) leaves.

   *Induction step:* Let \(n_k\) to be the number of nodes of height \(k\), then
   we have \(n_k \leq \lceil n/2^{k+1} \rceil\), and we know the nodes of height
   \(k+1\) are parents of the nodes of height \(k\), so we have
   \begin{align*}
   n_{k+1}
   &=\lceil n_k/2 \rceil\\
   &\leq\lceil \lceil n/2^{k+1} \rceil / 2\rceil\\
   &=\lceil n/2^{k+2} \rceil
   \end{align*}

   *Finally:* There are at most \(\lceil n/2^{h+1} \rceil\) nodes of height
   \(h\) in any \(n\)-element heap.
