   *Initialization:* A[1..n] is a max heap contains the \(n\) smallest elements,
   A[n+1..n] is empty.

   *Maintenance:* At the start of ith iteration, A[1] is the root of the max
   heap A[1..i] which contains the \(i\) smallest elements of A[1..n], thus A[1]
   is the ith largest element, and A[i+1..n] contains the \(n-i\) largest
   elements of A[1..n] and is sorted, after we exchange A[1] with A[i], A[i..n]
   contains the \(n-i+1\) largest elements of A[1..n] and is sorted, and the
   A[1..i-1] is a max heap besides A[1], then we perform MAX-HEAPIFY on A[1],
   after that A[1..i-1] becomes a max heap containing the \(i-1\) smallest
   elements of A[1..n].

   *Termination:* The procedure terminates when \(i=1\), A[1] is the smallest
   element of A[1..n], and A[2..n] contains the \(n-1\) largest elements of
   A[1..n] and is sorted, thus A[1..n] is the sorted permutation of the input
   array A.

   Both of them have \(\Theta(n\lg n)\) running time, the BUILD-MAX-HEAP costs
   \(O(n)\) running time, and the sort loop costs \(\Theta(n\lg n)\) running
   time.
** 6.4-4
   If A is already sorted in decreasing order, then each MAX-HEAPIFY in the sort
   loop will keep moving the root element till the bottom of the heap, thus the
   running time of the sort loop is
   \begin{align*}
   T(n)
   &=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(\Theta(1)+\Theta(\lfloor \lg(n-i)\rfloor))\\
   &\geq \Omega(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(\lg(i/2)))+\Omega(n)\\
   &=\Omega(n\lg n)
   \end{align*}
** 6.4-5
   The BUILD-MAX-HEAP has linear running time, so we just need to analyze the
   runnig time of the sort loop.

   Assume there are \(2^k - 1\) elements, then the max heap is a height \(k\)
   complete heap, we mark the nodes from top to bottom as level \(1\) to \(k\).

   There are \(2^{k-1}\) nodes at \(k\) level, and obviously there are at most
   \(2^{k-2}\) largest nodes at \(k\) level, thus there are at least
   \(2^{k-2} - 1\) large nodes at \(1\) to \(k - 1\) levels, and there are
   totally \(2^{k-3} - 1\) nodes at \(1\) to \(k - 3\) levels, so there are at
   least \(2^{k-3}\) large nodes at \(k - 2\) or \(k - 3\) level, these nodes
   need totally at least \(2^{k-3}(k-3)\) moves to get to the top, the running
   time is \(\Omega(n\lg n)\).
