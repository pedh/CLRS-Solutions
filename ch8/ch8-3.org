   - The insertion-sort and merge-sort are stable, heapsort and quicksort are not stable
   - Store the original index of each elements, if two elements are equal, compare the index

     The running time is not asymptotically changed

     The additional space is n * (space of an index) = \(n\lg n\) bits
** 8.3-3
   d digits elements array radix sort

   - Base case
     i = 1, sort the array on lowest-order digit means radix sorted
   - Inductive step
     + Assume k digits are radix sorted, do stable sort on i = k + 1 digit

     + Consider comparison of two elements a and b, the ith bit is a_i and b_i

       if a_i > b_i, then a > b

       if a_i < b_i, then a < b

       if a_i = b_i, then the order of a and b is same as they were in the k digits radix sort

     + The array are k + 1 digits radix sorted
   - By mathematical induction, the radix sort algorithm works
   - The assumption that the intermediate sort is stable is needed when a_i = b_i
** 8.3-4
   \(T(n) = \Theta(\frac{b}{r}(n + 2^r)), b = 3\lg n\)

   b > \lg n, so choose r = \lg n

   \(T(n) = \Theta(\frac{3\lg n}{\lg n}(n + 2^{\lg n})) = \Theta(6n) = \Theta(n)\)

   Perform 3-digit radix sort on the array, each digit is from 0 to n - 1
** 8.3-5
   - \(\sum^{d - 1}_{i = 0}10^i = \frac{10^d - 1}{9}\) sorting passes
