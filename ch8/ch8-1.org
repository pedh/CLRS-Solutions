#+TITLE: Chapter 8.1

* ch8.1
** 8.1-1
   Consider a graph \(G = (V, E)\), which \(V\) represents the set of all \(n\)
   elements, and \(E\) represents the set of all comparison, then we should
   connect graph \(G\) for a comparison sort, at we need at least \(n - 1\)
   edges, thus the smallest possible depth of a leaf in a decision tree for a
   comparison sort is \(n - 1\).

   For example, we do comparisons between \(a_i\) and \(a_{i+1}\)
   for \(i \in [1, n - 1]\),
   when \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq ... \leq a_{n-1} \leq a_n\).
** 8.1-2
   Since \(\lg k\) is monotonically increasing, we can approximate the summation
   use the formula \(A.11\).
   \begin{align*}
   \int_{0}^{n}\lg(x)dx
   \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n}\lg k
   \leq \int_{1}^{n+1}\lg(x)dx
   \end{align*}
   Evaluate the integral, we have
   \begin{align*}
   \frac{n(\lg n-1)}{\ln 2}
   \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n}\lg k
   \leq \frac{(n+1)(\lg(n+1)-1)}{\ln 2}
   \end{align*}
   From the inequation, we obtain the asymptotically tight bounds
   \(\Theta(n\lg n)\).
** 8.1-3
   Assume the running time is at most \(cn\), we know that there are at most
   \(2^{cn+1}\) leaves under depth \(cn\).

   Since \(2^{cn+1} = o(\frac{1}{2}n!)\), there is no comparison sort whose
   running time is linear for at least half of the \(n!\) inputs of length
   \(n\).

   Since \(2^{cn+1} = o(\frac{1}{n}n!)\), there is no comparison sort whose
   running time is linear for at a fraction of \(1/n\) of the \(n!\) inputs of
   length \(n\).

   Since \(2^{cn+1} = o(\frac{1}{2^n}n!)\), there is no comparison sort whose
   running time is linear for at a fraction of \(1/2^n\) of the \(n!\) inputs of
   length \(n\).
** 8.1-4
   Build a decision tree to represent a comparison sort of the given problem,
   assume the number of leaves is \(l\) and the height of the tree is \(h\),
   we know that
   \begin{align*}
   (k!)^{\frac{n}{k}} \leq l \leq 2^h
   \end{align*}
   Take logarithms on the inequation, we have
   \begin{align*}
   h
   &\geq \frac{n}{k}\lg(k!)\\
   &=\Omega(n\lg k)
   \end{align*}
   Thus the lower bound of the number of comparisons is \(\Omega(n\lg k)\).
