   - When all elements falls to one bucket, the running time is \(\Theta(n^2)\)
   - Use \(\Theta(n^2)\) sorting algorithm like heapsort or merge sort instead
     of insertion sort
** 8.4-3
   E[X] = 0 * 1/4 + 1 * 1/2 + 2 * 1/4 = 1

   E[X^2] = 0 * 1/4 + 1 * 1/2 + 4 * 1/4 = 1.5

   E^2[X] = (E[X])^2 = 1
** 8.4-4
   The possibility of points falls into a bucket is
   Pr[B] = Area(B) / Area(All) = Area(B) / \pi

   The kth bucket is
   \(B_k \{\sqrt{\frac{i - 1}{n}} < d_i \leq \sqrt{\frac{i}{n}} \}\)
** 8.4-5
   P(B_i) = i / n
